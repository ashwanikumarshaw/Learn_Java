	/*
	 * If a subclass provides a specific implementation of a 
	 * method that is already provided by its parent class, 
	 * it is known as Method Overriding. It is used for runtime 
	 * polymorphism and to implement the interface methods.

	Rules for Method overriding

	The method must have the same name as in the parent class.
	The method must have the same signature as in the parent class.
	Two classes must have an IS-A relationship between them.
