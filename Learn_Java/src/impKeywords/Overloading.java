	 * Method overloading is the polymorphism technique which 
	 * allows us to create multiple methods with the same name 
	 * but different signature. 
	 * 
	 * We can achieve method overloading in two ways.
		Changing the number of arguments
		Changing the return type
		
		Note: In Java, method overloading is not possible by changing 
		the return type of the program due to avoid the ambiguity.
