             #######        SINGLETON CLASS      #######
             
//Private constructor to resrict instantiation of the class of 
	the other classes

STEP 1. make constructor private (AppConfig) so that 
			it can't get access from out side the class

//Private static variable of the same class that is the only 
	instance of the class	
		
STEP 2. create the a private static obj using private constructor 
				in that class only

//Public static method that return the instance of the class ,
the global access point for outer world to get the instance of the same singleton class

STEP 3. create a fun to return that object using getInstance()


Note : 
	>>How to fetch object in other classes ?
	
		AppConfig obj=AppConfig.getInstance();
		obj.work();
		
	>>Why we need singleton class ?
		
		Suppose we are making a app and we need some data to start the app
		so make an object of get data class
		now in other functionality we again need some data 
		and we create obj of get data class
		this can make our app laggey or slow 
		as input , output , read and write takes a lot of time .
		So by using Singleton class we will make get data class 
		and make only one object and make it return to other classes
